# 📦 Project 5: End-to-End DevSecOps Transformation

## 1. Overview 🚀
This project simulates a **complete DevSecOps transformation** for a fictional company following a simulated security breach. It brings together all key areas of DevSecOps — infrastructure, application, CI/CD, security scanning, and incident response — in a unified workflow.

The goal is to showcase how a DevSecOps engineer can secure a company's entire SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) from the ground up, with emphasis on automation, least privilege, and defense-in-depth.

## 2. Key Technologies & Tools 🛠
- **Terraform** ⚙️  
  - Automates secure AWS infrastructure (VPC, IAM, S3, EC2) with centralized state management.
- **GitHub Actions** 🤖  
  - Automates CI/CD workflows including security scans, image builds, and deployments.
- **Trivy** 🔎  
  - Scans both Docker images and source code for vulnerabilities (SCA + image security).
- **Checkov** 🧪  
  - Performs static analysis of Terraform code to detect misconfigurations (IaC scanning).
- **Docker + ECS** 🐳  
  - Containerizes the application and deploys it securely using Amazon ECS with IAM role separation.
- **OWASP ZAP** 🛡  
  - Runs DAST scans against the live ECS deployment to simulate external threat detection.
- **Threat Modeling Frameworks** 🧠  
  - STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, and the Cyber Kill Chain used to simulate attacker behavior and response.

## 3. Security Highlights 🔒
- **Secure Infrastructure by Default**  
  - Terraform builds cloud environments with encryption, restricted IAM policies, and private networking.
- **Multi-Layered Security Pipeline**  
  - The CI/CD pipeline integrates SAST, SCA, IaC scanning, secrets detection, and image scanning.
- **Application + Runtime Protection**  
  - Docker images are built from trusted base layers, scanned, and deployed using least privilege ECS task roles.
- **Live DAST Scanning**  
  - ZAP performs dynamic scans against the deployed ECS app to detect real-time vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLi.
- **Simulated Breach & Incident Response**  
  - The project includes a threat modeling and IR exercise, showing how to identify, triage, and mitigate a mock attack scenario.

## 4. CI/CD Workflow 🔄
1. **Code Commit Triggers Pipeline**  
   - GitHub Actions begins a multi-job pipeline based on changes to infrastructure or app code.
2. **Security Pre-Checks (Shift-Left)**  
   - `Checkov` scans Terraform before deployment  
   - `Trivy` scans app dependencies (SCA) and Docker images  
   - `Gitleaks` checks for secrets
3. **Secure Infrastructure Deployment**  
   - If all checks pass, Terraform provisions the AWS environment (VPC, EC2, IAM, etc.).
4. **App Build & Deployment**  
   - Docker image is built and pushed to Docker Hub, then deployed to ECS using rolling updates.
5. **Post-Deployment DAST**  
   - OWASP ZAP scans the ECS service through the public Load Balancer and generates reports.
6. **Threat Modeling & Response Simulation**  
   - Uses a known attack path to simulate a breach, document findings, and run a NIST-aligned IR playbook.

## 5. Value for Organizations 💼
- **Real-World DevSecOps Implementation**  
  - Shows how to transition from insecure to secure systems with minimal disruption.
- **Full Lifecycle Security**  
  - Covers everything from IaC and source code scanning to runtime protection and incident response.
- **Demonstrates Ownership & Expertise**  
  - Reflects the DevSecOps mindset of continuous improvement, automation, and security-as-code.
- **Ideal Case Study**  
  - Great for stakeholders, hiring managers, and tech leads looking for an engineer who understands both depth and breadth.

## 6. Conclusion ✅
This project is the culmination of all prior work — a practical demonstration of how DevSecOps principles can secure infrastructure, pipelines, and applications from day one. By combining automation, monitoring, testing, and incident response, it reflects a **production-grade security lifecycle** ready to scale.

> 📌 This is an evolving case study. More components and advanced security integrations (SIEM, GuardDuty, IR playbooks) will be added as the project matures.
